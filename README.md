# Lab-Description
Dr. Mohammad Hassan Asmani founded the ACRRL Lab at Shiraz University in July 2018. In this laboratory, researches are based on the practical implementation and application of advanced and intelligent control methods on various systems such as robotic systems, medical engineering, and so on. In addition to actual experiments, basic researches on existing control methods such as robust, fractional, intelligent, LPV-based control methods are carried out to enhance and optimize them in the form of master and doctoral theses. Besides, the lab has provided the perfect platform for presenting and performing undergraduate creative student projects in the form of an undergraduate project. Lab Research Areas:
